# React TodoList App

This is my first React App :tada:
It is a simple todo list which allows you to add, check (uncheck) or remove todos from a random list generated by the [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API.
Feel free to leave a comment.
Tips and suggestions are more than welcome, the goal is to learn and improve :rocket:
