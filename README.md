### Project
This is my first React App :tada:  
It is a simple todo list which allows you to add, check (uncheck) or remove todos from a random list generated by the [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API.  
Feel free to leave a comment.  
Tips and suggestions are more than welcome, the goal is to learn and improve :rocket:
