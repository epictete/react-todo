### Project

This is my first React App :tada:  
It is a simple todo list which allows you to add, check (uncheck) or remove todos from a random list of 10 items generated by an external API.  
Feel free to leave a comment.  
Tips and suggestions are more than welcome, the goal is to learn and improve :rocket:

### Features

- Functionnal components using hooks (UseState & UseEffect)
- Using fetch API instead of Axios - for fun and for practice :wink:
- [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API for the todos
- React Router (Home / About)
- PropTypes
- Styling : inline / method
- Component drilling
- [UUID v4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for publication
